The task is to create a Pacman on demand (Add PacMan) and move these pacmen across the page.

Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

How to Run: 

Fork repo to use these 3 starter files
- 4 PacMan images ( Mouth Open, Mouth Close, Left To Right, Right to Left )
- index.html file contains an id ='game' that gives a handle on the element 
- pacmen.js file contains js code to Implement the makePac() and checkCollisions() functions

Roadmap of future improvements:
- Intend to have a Pause button to pause the game
- When the pacman hits the collision, pacman should face the reverse direction
